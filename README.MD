this is a barebones messaging board, written with Express, and the use of Express app generator for boiler plate code.
Using this project, I have learnt the basic CRUD of a express:
Connecting an express app server to a mongoDB database
- Basics of managing a database: Schemas and Query Strings
- Basics of POST request: json calls and bodyparsing to retrieve user input to DB
- Basics of GET request: rendering files upon request. Static files included
- Basics of PUG view template to render dynamic HTML with JS logic inbuilt

****** Working on as of 11/7/2023 ******
- Basic DELETE and PUT functionality
- Styling of web page
- Deployment via hosts like Heroku
